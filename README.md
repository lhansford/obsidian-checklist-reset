# Obsidian Checklist Reset

This plugin adds a command to reset the state of any checklists in a document in Obsidian. It will currently
work for Markdown and Canvas files.

## Usage

This plugin adds the following commands to the Command Palette:

| Command name              | Description                                                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reset checklists          | Uncheck all checked checklist items in the open document.               |
| Check all                 | Check all unchecked checklist items in the open document.               |
| Reset selected checklists | Uncheck the selected checklist items. Only available in editor mode.    |

### Settings

**Delete text on reset**

If this value is set with a string or a Regular Expression, any text in the checklist item line that matches it will be
removed when reset. This can be useful for stripping metadata, like that generated by the [Obisidian Tasks plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks).
